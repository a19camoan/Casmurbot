# Casmurbot

## Description

Casmurbot is a Telegram bot written in JavaScript using [grammY](https://grammy.dev/). The idea that gave birth to this bot was to create a bot that cleans Twitter and Reddit links from tracking parameters and shortens them to a more readable format, also adding [fx](https://github.com/FixTweet/FxTwitter) or [rxddit](https://github.com/MinnDevelopment/fxreddit) to better embed the tweet in the chat.

Also, the bot has a few other features, such as a ban, kick and unban

## Usage

To use the bot, you can start a chat with it on Telegram by searching for `@casmurbot` or by clicking [here](https://t.me/casmurbot).
