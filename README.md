# Casmurbot

## Description

Casmurbot is a Telegram bot written in JavaScript using [grammY](https://grammy.dev/). The idea that gave birth to this bot was to create a bot that cleans Twitter links from tracking parameters and shortens them to a more readable format, also adding [fx](https://github.com/FixTweet/FxTwitter) to better embed the tweet in the chat.
